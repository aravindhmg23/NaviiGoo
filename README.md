Indoor Navigation Project
This project aims to achieve efficient and optimal pathfinding through the use of the A* algorithm by designing the indoor navigation system. The system will help users move through difficult indoor facility layouts like college campuses, malls, hospitals and office buildings by calculating the distances between the set points. This project intends to improve the effectiveness of indoor navigation systems, facilitate the use of the systems, and address issues resulting from dependency on GPS functionality in confined spaces.

While GPS innovation facilitates navigation in the outdoor environment, moving around in an indoor place need external GPS Module (like Beacons, RFID and so on) which remains a challenge because of electronic signal loss and lack of appropriate positioning techniques. To Help with this problem, this project aims to create an indoor navigation optimized using A* star algorithms to provide pathfinding for enclosed spaces such as college campuses, malls, hospitals, and office buildings in a digital image map.

 A* algorithm is one of the most famous path searching and graph search algorithms where the created digital image pathway of any building will be represent in form of graph and each point of area will get unique coordinates which solves the problem of cons in using electronics and hence break the barrier with AI. With the implementation of A*, and a digitized indoor map the system makes sure that users are guided through spaces without obstacles and restricting zones. This smart indoor navigation system will solve the real-life indoor navigation issues with smart digital solutions making it easier and more user friendly to navigate in large buildings.

The Following are the steps to stimulate this project 
1.DATA COLLECTION- Collecting the Details, Layout, Structure of the Building
2.DATA TO DIGITAL MAP- Converting the data to precise image 
3.IDENTYING NODES AND EDGES GRAPH- Each Area of Interest in the image will get unique coordinates called as nodes and connecting them is called edges
4.SOURCE CODE- Will Be attached below 
5.DISPLAY OUTPUT ON USER INTERCE IN WEB PAGE 

Creating an indoor navigation system using the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from the origin to the destination (both will be given by the user since real time navigation isn't possible in this project). The digital image map is represented as a graph, where nodes represent different locations and
edges represent the possible paths between them. The A algorithm* is applied to calculate the shortest path using the cost function (A* path is build in python)

The source code for this project is developed using Python for implementing the A* algorithm, HTML, CSS, for the creation of web page for the user to access. The UI allows users to input the start and end points and displays the calculated shortest path on the image map. This system provides accurate indoor navigation, making it suitable for smart guidance system.

This Project Overcomes all the limitations (excluding real time navigation) of the currently existing indoor navigations by installing external GPS module
